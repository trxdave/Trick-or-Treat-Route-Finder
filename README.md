# 🎃 Project Summary

Trick-or-Treat Route Finder is a Halloween-themed web app that allows users to find, mark, and share the best trick-or-treat spots in their area.
It was created during Code Institute’s Hack or Treat 2025 Hackathon to combine fun, collaboration, and real-world mapping features.
Users can drop pins on a map to show houses giving candy, mark spots that have run out, or plan a safe route for trick-or-treating night.
